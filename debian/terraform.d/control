Description: Declarative infrastructure as code (download package)
  Terraform enables you to safely and predictably create, change, and improve
  infrastructure. It is an open source tool that codifies APIs into declarative
  configuration files that can be shared amongst team members, treated as code,
  edited, reviewed, and versioned.

  This package simply downloads the ZIP files from Hashicorp's website.
